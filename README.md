## BeyondCode Mailbox

This package is heavily inspired by [Laravel Mailbox by BeyondCode](https://github.com/beyondcode/laravel-mailbox), but it aims to be more flexible, extensible, and less opinionated. The main difference is that this package does not provide any filtering or routing out of the box; instead, it provides a simple interface to build your own. This package also does not offer any UI or database migrations.

The intended usage of this package is to listen for the `BaseCodeOy\Mailbox\Event\MailReceived` event and then process the incoming email using your logic. This approach allows you to create your filtering system and to use your database models, preventing you from being forced into using a specific architecture or database structure.

Additionally, you can configure multiple connections for each driver and use them simultaneously. This capability allows you to use multiple email providers at the same time. For example, you could use Mailgun for your transactional emails and SparkPost for your marketing emails.
